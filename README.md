# Landing Page

Built with **Node.js** and **MySQL**. 
Website for a start-up or a grand event opening where the user is entering his/her email to join. User emails are stored in a database and once the user is submiting his/her email, data is added to the database and the total number of users who already joined is being refreshed and displayed.


## Installation


Install all the dependecies from package.json(express, mysql, ejs, body-parser, faker) and start the server:

    $ npm init
    $ node app.js

Start the database connection with the proper host and user:

    $ mysql-ctl start
    $ mysql-ctl cli


## PLATFORMS: 
I used Cloud9 for a quick development setup.
